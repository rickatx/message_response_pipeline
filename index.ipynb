    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A potentially useful source of information for disaster relief agencies during disaster response are the communications by individuals affected by the disaster, either direct or through social media. The problem is that there are are millions of communications, only a small fraction of which are relevant. Particularly during a disaster response, agencies have the least capacity to filter these messages manually. So it is useful to be able to automatically classify these messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project creates a pipeline to process classified messages, and thereby train a model that can be used to predict classifications of messages during disaster response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs to the ETL pipeline are messages received during a disaster, and categorizations of the need expressed by the messages\n",
    "(e.g., \"shelter\", \"medical_help\", \"food\", \"aid_related\", etc.) The ETL pipeline transforms the data into a format suitable\n",
    "as input to a supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML pipeline reads the data generated by the ETL pipeline and trains a model. The purpose of the model is to predict\n",
    "the needs expressed by new messages so that messages can be automatically classified during a live disaster response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a web app both displays some statistics on the dataset used for training, and allows the user to experiment with the \n",
    "trained model by entering arbitrary (English language) message text, and seeing the need categories predicted by the model."
